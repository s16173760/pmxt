# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.17.9] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK: Server startup race condition causes 401 Unauthorized**: After a version mismatch was detected, the `ServerManager` would kill the old server and delete the lock file, then call `waitForServer()`. Because the lock file was gone, `getRunningPort()` fell back to the default port 3847. If any other process (e.g. an unrelated local server) was already responding on that port, `waitForServer()` would return immediately with no lock file present, causing `getAccessToken()` to return `undefined` and all subsequent API requests to be sent without an auth token. Fixed by rewriting `waitForServer()` to read the lock file directly on each poll iteration and only return when a lock file is present *and* the server at that file's port passes a health check. This prevents falsely matching an unrelated server on the default port.

## [2.17.8] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Python SDK `fetch_ohlcv` deserialization error**: Calling `fetch_ohlcv()` raised `ValueError: Multiple matches found when deserializing... with oneOf schemas: HistoryFilterParams, OHLCVParams` because the OpenAPI spec emitted `oneOf: [OHLCVParams, HistoryFilterParams]` for the `params` argument. Since both schemas are structurally identical in JSON (same four fields, differing only in `resolution` being optional vs. required), pydantic matched both branches and raised an exception. Fixed by removing the deprecated `HistoryFilterParams` union from `fetchOHLCV` in `BaseExchange.ts` and all exchange implementations, then regenerating the OpenAPI spec. The spec now emits only `OHLCVParams` for this parameter. `fetchTrades` is unaffected as its `HistoryFilterParams | TradesParams` union has no structural ambiguity.

## [2.17.7] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Python SDK Missing Exchange Classes**: `pmxt.Probable`, `pmxt.Baozi`, and `pmxt.Myriad` raised `AttributeError` on import because the Python SDK's exchange subclasses were maintained manually and had drifted from the TypeScript core. All three classes are now available.

### Infrastructure

- **Auto-generated Python SDK exchange classes**: `sdks/python/pmxt/_exchanges.py` is now generated from `core/src/server/app.ts` (the single source of truth for registered exchanges) via `core/scripts/generate-python-exchanges.js`. The generator also keeps `__init__.py` imports and `__all__` in sync. A CI guard (`python-exchanges-check.yml`) fails any PR where the generated file diverges from the committed one.
- **Auto-generated `COMPLIANCE.md`**: The feature support matrix is now generated from exchange implementations via `core/scripts/generate-compliance.js`, replacing the previously manual document. A CI guard (`compliance-check.yml`) keeps it in sync with `core/src/exchanges/*/index.ts`.
- **TypeScript SDK client methods CI guard**: Added `typescript-client-check.yml` to fail PRs where `BaseExchange.ts` changes without regenerating the corresponding methods in the TypeScript SDK `client.ts`.
- All three generators are wired into `generate:sdk:all` and run automatically on every publish.

## [2.17.6] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Duplicate `eventId` in `UnifiedMarket` causes build failure**: The v2.17.5 fix added `eventId?: string` to `core/src/types.ts` but the field already existed at line 34, resulting in `TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'eventId'` and a broken build. The duplicate declaration is removed.

## [2.17.5] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **`UnifiedMarket.event` circular type corrected to `eventId`**: The `event?: UnifiedEvent` field on `UnifiedMarket` (in both `core/src/types.ts` and the TypeScript SDK `models.ts`) was a design error — storing a full back-reference to the parent event creates a circular structure that breaks `JSON.stringify`. The field is now typed as `eventId?: string`, consistent with how every exchange util already populated it. The TypeScript SDK's `convertMarket` function now also passes `eventId` through from the server response.

## [2.17.4] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Polymarket Cloudflare WAF Bypass**: The User-Agent header added in v2.17.2 was insufficient to bypass Polymarket's Cloudflare bot detection. Enhanced the Polymarket client with browser-mimicking headers (`Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Origin: https://polymarket.com`, `Referer`, and `sec-fetch-*` directives). These headers make requests appear as same-site CORS calls from the Polymarket frontend, allowing the API to pass Cloudflare's bot scoring model. `fetchEvents()` now works reliably on all platforms.

## [2.17.3] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Fatal Circular JSON Crash (`fetchEvents`)**: Fixed a `TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON` that fatally crashed the sidecar server on every `fetchEvents` call across all exchanges. The v2.17.2 patch injected `market.event = event` inside the core exchange functions, creating an `event → markets[0] → event` reference cycle. Since Express serializes sidecar responses via `JSON.stringify`, this caused an unrecoverable crash propagated to all SDK clients. The `market.event` back-references are now hydrated exclusively client-side inside `convertEvent` in the TypeScript SDK, keeping all sidecar REST payloads strictly acyclic.

## [2.17.2] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Bi-directional Navigation (`market.event`)**: Added `market.event` back-reference hydration to the TypeScript SDK's `convertEvent` function, enabling navigation from any market to its parent event. Note: this release accidentally also injected the circular reference server-side, causing a fatal JSON serialization crash fixed in v2.17.3.
- **Global User-Agent Header**: Added a default generic `User-Agent` header (`pmxt (https://github.com/pmxt-dev/pmxt)`) to the `BaseExchange` axios configuration. This ensures consistent identification across all exchanges and resolves the **Polymarket Discovery 401 Error** that occurred when calling `fetchEvents()` without parameters, effectively bypassing WAF/CDN restrictions.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Sidecar Bundle Drift**: The features shipped in 2.17.0 (parameterless `fetchEvents()`, Kalshi client-side sorting) were correctly implemented in TypeScript source but **never reached users** because the publish pipeline was missing the `bundle:server` step for the npm job. The distributed `pmxt-core` package contained a stale pre-compiled sidecar (`bundled.js`) from a previous release that still enforced the old guard `fetchEvents() requires a query, eventId, or slug parameter`. This patch rebuilds and ships the correct bundle.
- **CI/CD: Publish Workflow**: Added `npm run bundle:server` to the `publish-npm` job in `publish.yml`, immediately after the `Build Core` step. Without this, source-level changes to the sidecar server are silently ignored in all npm-distributed packages.
- **CI/CD: Test Workflow**: Applied the same fix to `test-publish.yml` so dry-run publishes and test runs also exercise the correct sidecar, preventing this class of drift from going undetected in future PRs.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-02-24

### Improved

- **Unified Discovery: Unrestricted Event Fetching**: Removed the mandatory requirement for a query, event identification, or slug in `fetchEvents`. Users can now call `fetchEvents()` without parameters to retrieve the "front page" of an exchange (typically top events by volume).
- **Polymarket: High-Performance Discovery**: Redirects no-query `fetchEvents` calls to the specific Gamma `/events` list endpoint, providing a cleaner and faster experience than the fuzzy search path.
- **Kalshi: Client-Side Event Ranking**: Implemented robust client-side sorting for Kalshi events. Since the Kalshi API lacks server-side sorting for the event list, `fetchEvents` now aggregates volume, liquidity, and recency from nested markets to provide consistent `sort` support (`volume`, `liquidity`, `newest`).
- **Limitless: Semantic Event Mapping**: Mapped Limitless "Group Markets" to the unified `fetchEvents` interface. Discovery calls now automatically filter for group markets, aligning Limitless with event-centric discovery patterns.
- **Developer Experience**: Synchronized `fetchEvents` behavior with `fetchMarkets` across all exchanges (Baozi, Myriad, Probable, Kalshi, Polymarket, Limitless).

### Fixed

- **Unit Tests**: Updated core validation suite to reflect the relaxed requirements for event fetching.

## [2.16.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Documentation: Automated Generator**: Fixed a bug in `generate-openapi.js` where certain model fields (like `eventId` and `sort`) were not being correctly reflected in the generated SDK documentation.
- **SDK: Regenerated Reference Docs**: Synchronized `API_REFERENCE.md` for both Python and TypeScript to include the newly added traversal and sorting capabilities.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Unified Traversal: Market-to-Event Linkage**: Added `eventId` to the `UnifiedMarket` interface across all exchanges. This allows direct navigation from a market back to its parent event container.
- **Unified Traversal: Outcome-to-Market Linkage**: Ensured `marketId` is consistently populated on all `MarketOutcome` objects.
- **Event Search: Unified Sorting**: Added `sort` parameter support to `fetchEvents` for better developer experience and consistency with `fetchMarkets`.

### Improved

- **Polymarket: Direct Event Lookup**: Enhanced `fetchEvents` for Polymarket to support direct `eventId` and `slug` lookups, removing the previous requirement for a keyword search query when the ID is already known.
- **Cross-Exchange Consistency**: Synchronized `fetchEvents` and `fetchMarkets` behavior across Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Myriad, and Probable.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **TypeScript SDK: Automated Client Method Generation**: Introduced `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-client-methods.js`, a script that introspects `BaseExchange.ts` via the TypeScript AST and auto-generates typed client method stubs in `client.ts`. This ensures the TypeScript SDK stays in sync with core method additions without manual updates.
- **TypeScript SDK: SDK Surface Area Tests**: Added `sdks/typescript/tests/surface.test.ts` with 175 tests (25 public methods × 7 exchange classes). These tests verify that every method defined in `BaseExchange` is correctly exposed on all exchange clients (Polymarket, Kalshi, KalshiDemo, Limitless, Myriad, Probable, Baozi). No server required — prototype checks only.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK: Integration Test Reliability**: Refactored `sdks/typescript/tests/integration.test.ts` to use a shared `beforeAll` per describe block (avoiding redundant API calls per test), pass `{ limit: 5 }` to both Polymarket and Kalshi `fetchMarkets` to prevent full-catalog fetches, and set a 120s `beforeAll` timeout to handle Polymarket Gamma API response variance (which can exceed 30s under load). All 6 integration tests now pass reliably.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Sidecar Server Build**: Resolved a critical TypeScript compilation error in `app.ts` caused by an invalid Express error handler signature. This fix ensures the unified sidecar server can be successfully bundled and published.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Kalshi Demo Support**: Introduced full support for the Kalshi Demo (simulated) environment across both TypeScript and Python SDKs.
  - **TypeScript**: New `KalshiDemoExchange` class for direct access to the demo environment.
  - **Python**: Updated `Kalshi` class with a `demo=True` parameter for easy environment switching.
  - **Unified Configuration**: Centralized API and WebSocket URL management to ensure consistency between production and demo environments.
- **Dome API Migration**: Added a dedicated migration guide and landing page for users transitioning from the shut-down Dome API.
- **Kalshi Setup Documentation**: Included a comprehensive setup guide in the core documentation for Kalshi integration.

### Fixed

- **Kalshi Demo Connectivity**: Corrected internal API and WebSocket endpoints for the Kalshi Demo environment to ensure reliable connectivity.
- **Core Stability**: Resolved merge conflicts and performed general code cleanup in the sidecar server.

### Documentation

- **Project Metadata**: Updated download statistics and project badges.

## [2.13.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK Build**: Resolved type shadowing issues in the auto-generated SDK by ensuring all request body schemas in the OpenAPI specification carry a distinct `title` property.
- **Client Implementation**: Corrected calling conventions and type references in `client.ts` for `fetchBalance`, `cancelOrder`, and `fetchOrder` to align with the latest generated types.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK Build**: Resolved critical compilation errors introduced by OpenAPI spec auto-generation (v2.13.0).
  - Added missing `title` fields to inline request schemas in `openapi.yaml` (cancelOrder, fetchOrder endpoints) so the OpenAPI generator creates proper named types.
  - Fixed incorrect type references in `client.ts` `fetchOrder` method (was using `CancelOrderRequest` instead of `FetchOrderRequest`).
  - Enhanced `fix-generated.js` post-processing script to properly handle union type discriminators and TypeScript type narrowing issues in generated code.
  - Fixed type narrowing failures in `FilterEventsRequestArgsInner` and `FilterMarketsRequestArgsInner` by adding explicit type casts in `.every()` and `.map()` calls.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Unified Sidecar API Expansion**: Formally exposed `fetchMyTrades`, `fetchClosedOrders`, and `fetchAllOrders` in the sidecar server and generated SDKs, completing the functional rollout of the Order History API.
- **New Public Methods**: Introduced `loadMarkets()` and `fetchMarketsPaginated()` to the public SDKs for stateful market caching and stable pagination support.
- **OpenAPI Auto-Generation**: Implemented a reflection-based specification generator (`core/scripts/generate-openapi.js`) that automatically derives the sidecar API from the `BaseExchange` TypeScript definition.
- **CI Synchronization Check**: Added a GitHub Action workflow to ensure the OpenAPI spec and SDKs stay perfectly in sync with the core library on every contribution.

### Changed

- **SDK Feature Parity**: Regenerated both Python and TypeScript SDKs to include the latest unified methods and data models (e.g., `UserTrade`, `PaginatedMarketsResult`).

### Documentation

- **Contributor Workflow**: Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions on using the new automated OpenAPI generation pipeline.


## [2.12.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Security**: Bound the sidecar server to `127.0.0.1` by default to prevent accidental exposure on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

## [2.12.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Unified Order History API**: Standardized methods across all exchanges for retrieving private trade and order history.
  - New methods: `fetchMyTrades()`, `fetchClosedOrders()`, and `fetchAllOrders()`.
  - Introduced `UserTrade` type which includes `orderId` for linking trades to specific orders.
- **Exchange Support**:
  - Implemented `fetchMyTrades` for **Polymarket**, **Limitless**, **Myriad**, and **Probable**.
  - Implemented `fetchClosedOrders` and `fetchAllOrders` for **Kalshi**, **Polymarket**, **Limitless**, **Probable**, and **Myriad**.
- **Compliance Testing**: Added comprehensive test suites for validating order and trade history implementations across all exchanges.

### Changed

- **Testing Utilities**: Added `validateUserTrade` to compliance test suite for standardized trade verification.

- **Compliance Testing**: Added comprehensive test suites for validating order and trade history implementations across all exchanges.

### Changed

- **Testing Utilities**: Added `validateUserTrade` to compliance test suite for standardized trade verification.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **CCXT-Style Rate Limiting**: Implemented automatic rate limiting across all exchanges using a token bucket (leaky bucket) algorithm, preventing 429 errors and request throttling.
  - **Unified Throttling**: All REST requests (both explicit and via `callApi`) automatically respect exchange rate limits through a single axios request interceptor on `this.http`.
  - **Per-Exchange Configuration**: Each exchange sets its own rate limit (e.g., Polymarket: 200ms, Kalshi: 100ms, Myriad/Baozi/Probable: 500ms).
  - **User Control**: Developers can override rate limits per-instance (`exchange.rateLimit = 50`) or disable entirely (`exchange.enableRateLimit = false`).
  - **Leaky Bucket Implementation**: Queue-based token refill with no busy spinning, maintaining simplicity while ensuring fair request spacing.
- **Throttler Utility**: New `Throttler` class in `core/src/utils/throttler.ts` providing a standalone, exchange-agnostic token bucket implementation for queue-based async throttling.

### Changed

- **BaseExchange**: Added `rateLimit` property (default 1000ms) and `enableRateLimit` property (default true) to match CCXT conventions.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Low-Level API Access (`callApi` / `call_api`)**: Exposed a new method on all exchange instances that allows direct invocation of any exchange-specific REST endpoint by its OpenAPI `operationId`. This gives advanced users full access to every underlying API endpoint (Polymarket CLOB/Gamma/Data, Kalshi, Limitless, Probable, Myriad) without leaving the unified SDK interface.
  - TypeScript: `await exchange.callApi('operationName', { param: 'value' })`
  - Python: `exchange.call_api('operation_name', {'param': 'value'})`
- **Low-Level API Reference Documentation**: Both Python and TypeScript API reference docs now include a comprehensive "Low-Level API Reference" section listing every available endpoint per exchange, with method, path, parameters, and auth requirements.

### Documentation

- **API Reference Templates**: Updated Handlebars templates and the doc generation pipeline to render per-exchange endpoint tables and detailed parameter listings from OpenAPI specs.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-02-19

### Documentation

- **Pagination Stability Guidance**: Clarified that repeated `fetchMarkets()` calls with different `offset` values do not guarantee stable ordering. Added guidance and examples on using `loadMarkets()` as the correct approach for stable iteration over the entire market catalog. (Closes #41)
- **Automatic Statistics**: Updated specific total download badges and metadata.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-02-18

### Documentation

- **Internal Links in API Reference**: Return types and complex parameters in the Python and TypeScript API reference documentation are now linkified. Clicking on a data model (e.g., `Order`, `UnifiedMarket`) now jumps directly to its detailed field definition at the bottom of the page.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK (Windows)**: Fixed a crash when spawning `pmxt-ensure-server` on Windows where the `.js` launcher must be invoked via `node` explicitly. The SDK now detects the platform and spawns `node <path>` when the resolved launcher ends in `.js`. (Closes #29)

### Added

- **Implicit API Generation**: Implemented automatic HTTP method generation from OpenAPI specifications in `BaseExchange`. Exchange classes can now register an OpenAPI spec and have typed HTTP methods created dynamically, significantly reducing boilerplate when adding new exchanges or API endpoints.
  - Added `ApiDescriptor` interface and `parseOpenApiSpec` utility.
  - Added `initAuth()` method for credential initialization and HMAC-SHA256 signing for Polymarket L2 API authentication.
  - API credentials are cached for synchronous signing operations.
  - Full implicit API support added to `PolymarketExchange` for all three services (CLOB, Gamma, Data APIs).

### Changed

- **Centralized Request Handling (`callApi`)**: Refactored all major exchange implementations (Kalshi, Polymarket, Limitless, Probable, Myriad) to route API calls through a unified `callApi` method on `BaseExchange`. This ensures consistent error mapping, logging, and interceptor behavior across all exchanges.
- **Consolidated Exchange Methods**: Moved standalone per-feature files (`fetchPositions.ts`, `fetchOrderBook.ts`, `fetchTrades.ts`, `fetchOHLCV.ts`) into their respective exchange class files. Deleted the now-redundant standalone files.
- **Centralized OpenAPI Specs**: Migrated API specifications from the root directory into structured `core/specs/` subdirectories (kalshi, limitless, myriad, polymarket, probable). The `fetch-openapi-specs` script now supports both remote URL fetching and local file reading.
- **Myriad**: Inlined `fetchTrades` logic directly into WebSocket polling and migrated to `callApi`. Fixed outcomeId parsing for composite IDs.
- **OpenAPI Utility**: Operations without explicit security definitions now correctly inherit top-level security settings.

### Documentation

- **SubParams in API Reference**: Sub-parameters for methods like `fetchMarkets` and `fetchEvents` (e.g., `query`, `slug`, `limit`, `offset`, `sort`, `searchIn`) are now rendered as nested bullet points directly under the method in both Python and TypeScript API reference docs.
- **Implicit API Pattern**: Added detailed documentation of the Implicit API pattern to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Exchange Integration Guide**: Refactored `core/ADDING_AN_EXCHANGE.md` to reflect the new `callApi`-based implementation approach.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **CCXT-Style Market Caching (`loadMarkets`)**: Implemented stateful market caching in `BaseExchange` to improve performance and enable synchronous-like metadata lookups.
  - New `loadMarkets(reload: boolean)` method fetches and caches all market definitions (by ID and slug).
  - Updated `fetchMarket` to check the local cache first, enabling 0ms lookups for frequently accessed markets.
  - Added `slug` property to `UnifiedMarket` for consistent multi-identifier caching.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive unit tests and a cross-exchange manual verification script for the market caching system.

### Changed

- **Increased Default Market Limits**: Raised the default `fetchMarkets` limit from 10,000 to **250,000** results across Polymarket, Kalshi, and Limitless.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Centralized HTTP Architecture**: Refactored all major exchange clients (Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Probable, Myriad) to route API requests through a shared `this.http` instance in `BaseExchange`.
- **Enhanced Verbose Logging**: The `exchange.verbose = true` flag now provides consistent, detailed logging for *all* HTTP requests and responses, including parameters, status codes, and error bodies across all exchanges.
- **Improved Internal Reliability**: 
  - Standardized error mapping and request interceptors across the library.
  - Fixed syntax errors and prop-drilling issues in Myriad and Probable exchange implementations.
  - Updated Kalshi unit tests to support robust `axios.create` mocking patterns.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **CCXT-Style Capability Map (`exchange.has`)**: Introduced a unified capability mapping system across all exchanges. This allows developers to programmatically check which features (e.g., `fetchOHLCV`, `watchOrderBook`, `createOrder`) are supported or emulated by a specific exchange.
  - Added the `.has` property to `BaseExchange` and all exchange implementations (Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Probable, Myriad, Baozi).
  - New `/api/:exchange/has` endpoint in the sidecar server for remote capability discovery.
  - Python SDK updated to expose these capabilities on exchange instances.

### Changed

- **Repository & SDK Optimization**: Significantly reduced repository size and improved developer workflow by untracking generated server bundles in the Python SDK. These are now excluded from version control and managed during the build/dist process.
- **Improved Workspace Cleanliness**: Updated `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` to ensure temporary files, generated SDK code, and build artifacts stay out of the repository.

### Fixed

- **Baozi**: Refined internal documentation regarding pari-mutuel odds calculation status.
- **Documentation**: Updated project statistics and download badges to reflect latest growth.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Baozi Exchange Integration**: New exchange adapter for [baozi.bet](https://baozi.bet), a decentralized pari-mutuel prediction market on Solana. NOTE: Not fully working.
  - **Market Data**: `fetchMarkets`, `fetchEvents`, `fetchOrderBook` (synthetic from pool ratios).
  - **Trading**: `createOrder` via on-chain Solana instructions (`place_bet_sol` / `bet_on_race_outcome_sol`).
  - **Account Management**: `fetchBalance` (SOL), `fetchPositions` (PDA-based position lookup).
  - **Real-time Data**: `watchOrderBook` via Solana `onAccountChange` subscriptions.
  - Note: No `fetchOHLCV`, `fetchTrades`, or `cancelOrder` (pari-mutuel bets are irrevocable).

- **Myriad Markets Integration**: Full support for Myriad Markets, an AMM-based prediction market platform.
  - **Market Data**: `fetchMarkets`, `fetchEvents`, `fetchOHLCV`, `fetchOrderBook` (synthetic from AMM), `fetchTrades`.
  - **Trading**: `createOrder` (returns quote + calldata for on-chain execution), `fetchPositions`, `fetchBalance`.
  - **Real-time Data**: Poll-based `watchOrderBook` and `watchTrades`.
  - **Multi-chain Support**: Abstract (2741), Linea (59144), BNB (56) with composite IDs (`{networkId}:{marketId}:{outcomeId}`).
  - Key difference from CLOB exchanges: AMM-based, no limit orders or open order cancellation.

- **`fetchMarket` / `fetchEvent` Singular Lookup Methods**: Convenience methods for fetching a single market or event by ID, slug, or ticker. Throws `MarketNotFound` / `EventNotFound` if not found.
  - Extended `MarketFilterParams` with `marketId`, `outcomeId`, `eventId` for direct lookups.
  - Extended `EventFetchParams` with `eventId`, `slug` for direct lookups.
  - Exchange-specific implementations for Kalshi, Probable, and Limitless.

- **Improved Market Search**: Deduplication logic and exact-match fetching in parallel for Kalshi, Limitless, and Polymarket. Queries resembling tickers or slugs now prioritize exact matches.

### Fixed

- **Baozi**: Improved robustness of order parsing and position data.
- **Probable**: Added fallback lookup logic for slug search in `fetchMarkets`.

### Changed

- **Windows Compatibility**: Cross-platform process checking in LockFile and Python SDK.
- **Compliance Tests**: Enhanced with authentication support for Myriad and Baozi; refactored to use `initExchange` helper.
- **Generated SDK Code**: Now gitignored instead of committed.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-15

  - **Account Management**: Implemented `fetchBalance` and `fetchPositions` to track portfolio performance.
  - **Real-time Data**: Added WebSocket support for live order book updates via `watchOrderBook`. (Note: `watchTrades` is not yet supported).
  - **Examples**: Added comprehensive examples in `core/examples/api-reference` covering all major functionality.


## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-14

### Features

- **Outcome Shorthand for Trading**: You can now pass a `MarketOutcome` object directly to `createOrder` (TS) or `create_order` (Python) instead of manually specifying `marketId` and `outcomeId`.
- **`marketId` in `MarketOutcome`**: Market outcome objects now include the `marketId` they belong to, enabling the new shorthand functionality and better data traceability.

### Changed

- **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced input validation for order creation to ensure consistent behavior across different parameter combinations.
- **Documentation & Examples**: Updated trading examples to demonstrate the new recommended shorthand pattern.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-14

### Features

- **MarketList Convenience Class**: Introduced a new `MarketList` class to simplify market discovery and filtering. This provides a more ergonomic way to search and interact with collections of markets across different exchanges.
- **Developer Experience**: Added `npm run dev` command to support streamlined local development with automatic rebuilding and sidecar management.

### Documentation

- **Architecture Overview**: Added a comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` guide explaining the project's internal structure and core principles.
- **Exchange Contribution Guide**: Created `core/ADDING_AN_EXCHANGE.md` to provide clear instructions for developers looking to integrate new prediction markets.
- **Improved Onboarding**: Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed monorepo structure and prerequisites. Added `.env.example` to simplify local environment setup.
- **Node.js Environment**: Explicitly defined supported Node.js versions in `package.json` to ensure development environment consistency.


## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-14

### Features

- **Polymarket Performance Optimization**:
  - Implemented `preWarmMarket` in the `PolymarketExchange` class. This allows for caching market metadata (such as `tokenAddress` and `negRisk` status) before placing orders, significantly reducing latency during critical execution moments.
  - Streamlined the `createOrder` workflow by removing redundant `inferTickSize` logic and delegating default handling to the Polymarket SDK.
- **API Enhancements**: Added support for the `negRisk` parameter in `CreateOrderParams`, enabling more granular control over order types on Polymarket. <-- not in openapi schema yet
- **Developer Experience**: Added a new benchmarking script `core/scripts/test-order-speed.ts` for measuring end-to-end order placement latency.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- **Kalshi Pagination**: Implemented recursive pagination for Kalshi search, enabling the retrieval of up to 10,000 results per query (previously hard-limited to 200).
- **Kalshi 'All' Status**: Enhanced the `'all'` status filter to simultaneously fetch from `open`, `closed`, and `settled` endpoints, providing a truly comprehensive view of Kalshi events.
- **Polymarket Status Verification**: Added strict client-side status verification for Polymarket search to prevent "active" events from leaking into "closed" queries, ensuring high search precision.
- **Limitless Status Filtering**: Standardized status filtering for Limitless to correctly distinguish between active, expired, and resolved markets within search results.

### Changed

- **Unified Status Terminology**: Introduced `'inactive'` as a universal alias for `'closed'` across all exchange methods to provide a more intuitive API for non-binary market states.
- **Improved Documentation**: Enriched JSDoc metadata for `fetchMarkets` and `fetchEvents` with exchange-specific implementation details and usage examples.


## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- **Increased Default Limits**: The default limit for fetching markets and events has been increased to **10,000** results across all exchanges (Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless) to provide more comprehensive search results by default.
- **Polymarket Search Optimization**: Migrated `fetchEvents` search to use the high-performance Gamma `public-search` endpoint with parallel pagination, significantly improving discovery for high-volume markets.
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Updated `openapi.yaml` to reflect the new default limit of 10,000 for market and event queries.

### Added

- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrated automated GitHub release creation and unified publishing logic in `publish.yml`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Status Filtering**: Introduced a unified `status` parameter (`active`, `closed`, `all`) for both `fetchMarkets` and `fetchEvents`. This allows querying resolved/archived markets in addition to active ones. (Closes #33)
  - **Polymarket**: Full support for active/closed filtering via Gamma API integration.
  - **Kalshi**: Implemented status-aware fetching with cache-isolation to prevent data pollution.
  - **Limitless**: Added compliance handling that returns empty results for closed markets (unsupported by the provider).
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Updated `MarketFilterParams` and `EventFetchParams` schemas to include the new `status` property.

## [2.0.11] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Limitless Pagination**: Implemented automatic pagination for limits greater than 25 markets. The Limitless API has a hard limit of 25 items per request, so this update introduces internal pagination that transparently handles any limit value. Over-fetches by 70% to account for ~33% of markets being filtered out due to missing tokens, then applies limit after filtering to ensure users get the exact requested number of valid markets. (Fixes #34)

## [2.0.10] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Polymarket WebSocket License**: Updated `@nevuamarkets/poly-websockets` dependency from AGPL-3.0 versions to MIT version, resolving license incompatibility warnings. Removed all AGPL-3.0 references from source code comments and error messages to ensure full MIT license compliance. (Fixes #35)

- **Semantic Aliases**: Added a `.question` property alias to `UnifiedMarket` in the Python SDK, matching common developer expectations for prediction market queries.

### Fixed
- **Python SDK API Calls**: Fixed a regression where hierarchical search endpoints were missing from the auto-generated internal API client by implementing a robust manual fallback.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Python SDK Bundled Server**: Updated the internal bundled sidecar server to the latest version. This resolves a regression where the "Date Handling in OHLCV" fix (from v1.1.3) was not correctly applied in the Python distribution, causing `getTime is not a function` errors when fetching historical data.

### Improved
- **CI/CD**: Added an automated step to the GitHub Actions workflow to rebuild and bundle the sidecar server immediately before publishing the Python package, ensuring the PyPI distribution always contains the latest core server code.

  - The sidecar server now correctly accepts both native `Date` objects (from internal TS calls) and ISO 8601 strings (from external APIs/SDKs) for `start` and `end` parameters.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Server Lifecycle**: Resolved a critical race condition where multiple concurrent client instantiations (e.g., initializing both Polymarket and Kalshi simultaneously) would kill and restart the sidecar server, invalidating access tokens.
- **Version Detection**: Improved `package.json` discovery in the sidecar server to ensure correct version reporting in bundled environments.
- **SDK Stability**: Updated the Python `ServerManager` to be more tolerant of version suffixes (like `-b4` or `-dev`), preventing unnecessary server restarts during development.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-17

broken

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Core SDK (Universal)**: Implemented dynamic port detection via the `~/.pmxt/server.lock` file. This resolves `ConnectionRefusedError` issues when the default port (3847) is already in use and the server falls back to an alternative port.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Resolved a critical race condition where API calls could be executed before the internal server manager had finished starting the sidecar or detecting the actual running port. Standardized the initialization pattern using an internal `initPromise`.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Fixed `ServerManager` health checks to correctly target the dynamically detected port instead of always checking the default.
- **Python SDK**: Hardened the `ServerManager` logic and improved consistency with the TypeScript implementation.

### Added
- **Python**: Added `examples/test_port_detection.py` to demonstrate and verify the new dynamic port resolution logic.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
The new sidecar architecture works as follows:
1. **Core Server**: Node.js Express server (`pmxt-core`) runs locally and handles all exchange integrations
2. **SDK Clients**: Language-specific SDKs (Python, TypeScript) communicate with the core server via HTTP
3. **Auto-Management**: SDKs automatically start/stop the server as needed
4. **Type Safety**: OpenAPI specification ensures type consistency across all languages

#### Package Versions
- `pmxt-core`: 1.0.0
- `pmxtjs`: 1.0.0
- `pmxt` (Python): 1.0.0

#### Migration from v0.4.4
For TypeScript users:
```typescript
// v0.4.4 (still works)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();

// v1.0.0 (same API, new architecture)
import pmxt from 'pmxtjs';
const poly = new pmxt.Polymarket();
```

For Python users (new):
```python
import pmxt

poly = pmxt.Polymarket()
markets = poly.search_markets("Trump")
```

### Known Limitations

- **Node.js Dependency**: Both SDKs require Node.js to be installed (for the sidecar server)
- **Beta Features**: Some advanced features are still in beta (see `BETA_RELEASE.md`)
- **Exchange Coverage**: Currently supports Polymarket and Kalshi (more exchanges planned for v1.x.x)

### Acknowledgments

This release represents a major milestone in making prediction market data accessible across all major programming languages. Special thanks to all contributors and early testers who helped shape this architecture.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **ESM Import Compatibility**: Fixed an issue where `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` in ES Module environments (e.g., Node.js with `"type": "module"`) would wrap the default export in an extra `.default` property, breaking the expected `pmxt.polymarket()` syntax. Added explicit named exports (`polymarket`, `kalshi`) to ensure proper CommonJS/ESM interoperability.

### Added
- **Named Exports**: You can now import exchanges directly using named imports: `import { polymarket, kalshi } from 'pmxtjs'` in addition to the default `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` syntax.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Zombie Files in `dist/`**: Implemented a `prebuild` step that automatically cleans the `dist/` folder before every build. This prevents "stuck on old code" issues on macOS/Windows caused by file-to-directory refactors (e.g., `Kalshi.js` becoming `kalshi/index.js`).

### Added
- **Automated Publishing**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and publish to npm whenever a new repository tag (e.g., `v0.4.3`) is pushed.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Description Field**: Corrected a mapping issue where the unified `description` field was being populated with `event.sub_title` or `market.subtitle` (which typically only contain dates). It now correctly uses `market.rules_primary`, providing the actual resolution criteria as intended.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Metadata Enrichment**: Fixed a major data gap where Kalshi markets were returning empty `tags`. 
  - **The Issue**: The Kalshi `/events` and `/markets` endpoints do not expose tags. Tags are instead nested under the `/series` metadata, which wasn't being queried.
  - **The Fix**: Implemented a secondary fetch layer that retrieves Series metadata and maps it back to Markets.
  - **Unified Tags**: Standardized the provider data model by merging Kalshi's `category` and `tags` into a single unified `tags` array, ensuring consistency with Polymarket's data structure.

### Changed
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Modified `fetchMarkets` to fetch Series mapping in parallel with events and `getMarketsBySlug` to perform atomic enrichment.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Trading Support**: Added full trading support for **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**, including:
  - Order management: `createOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `fetchOrder`, `fetchOpenOrders`.
  - Account management: `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`.
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for all trading operations.
- **Examples**: Added new examples for trading and account data (e.g., `list_positions`).

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Refactored monolithic `Exchange` classes into modular files for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Simplified Polymarket authentication workflow.
- **Documentation**: Updated `API_REFERENCE.md` with detailed trading and account management methods.

### Fixed
- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved issues with ES modules in dependencies for testing.
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Fixed various bugs such as ticker formatting and signature generation.

### CRITICAL NOTES
- Polymarket has been tested manually, and works.
- Kalshi HAS NOT been tested manually but has been implemented according to the kalshi docs.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Search Scope Control**: Added `searchIn` parameter to `searchMarkets` allowing 'title' (default), 'description', or 'both'.

### Changed
- **Default Search Behavior**: `searchMarkets` now defaults to searching only titles to reduce noise and improve relevance.
- **Improved Search Coverage**: Increased search depth for both Polymarket and Kalshi to cover all active markets (up to 100,000) instead of just the top results.

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Updated README Quick Example to be robust against empty results.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **CCXT Syntax Alignment**: Renamed core methods to follow `ccxt` conventions:
  - `getMarkets` -> `fetchMarkets`
  - `getOrderBook` -> `fetchOrderBook`
  - `getTradeHistory` -> `fetchTrades`
  - `getMarketHistory` -> `fetchOHLCV`
- **Namespace Support**: Implemented `pmxt` default export to allow usage like `pmxt.polymarket`.

### Improved
- **Kalshi OHLCV**: Enhanced price mapping and added mid-price fallback for historical data.
- **Examples**: Updated `historical_prices.ts` to use new method names and improved logic.

### Fixed
- **Type Definitions**: Updated internal interfaces to match the new naming scheme.
- **Documentation**: Updated test headers and file references.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**: Added missing `ts-jest` dependency to ensure tests run correctly.
- **Search Robustness**: Fixed a potential crash in `searchMarkets` for both Kalshi and Polymarket when handling markets with missing descriptions or titles.
- **Data Validation**: Added better error handling for JSON parsing in Polymarket outcomes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **Unified Deep-Dive Method IDs**: Standardized the IDs used in deep-dive methods across exchanges to ensure consistency. This changes the return signatures of data methods.

### Improved
- **Examples**: Simplified and fixed examples, including `historical_prices`, `orderbook_depth`, and `search_grouping`, to better demonstrate library usage.
- **Example Data**: Updated default queries in examples for more relevant results.

### Documentation
- **README Enhancements**: Added badges, platform logos, and a visual overview image to the README.
- **License**: Added MIT License to the project.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **Cleaner Logs**: Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `KalshiExchange` and `PolymarketExchange` to ensure a quieter library experience.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Switched noisy data parsing warnings to silent failures or internal handling.
- **Repository Restructuring**: Flattened project structure for easier development and publishing.
- **readme.md**: Pushed readme.md to npmjs.org

### Removed
- `Fetched n pages from Kalshi...` logs.
- `Extracted n markets from k events.` logs.
- `Failed to parse outcomes` warnings in Polymarket.
