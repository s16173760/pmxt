# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.25.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **TypeScript and Python SDKs: dropped fields in `convertMarket` / `convertEvent`**: The hand-maintained converter shims at the top of `sdks/typescript/pmxt/client.ts` and `sdks/python/pmxt/client.py` had their own allowlists and were silently dropping `slug`, `tickSize`, `status`, `contractAddress` on `UnifiedMarket` and `volume`, `volume24h` on `UnifiedEvent` even though the sidecar populates them and the generated OpenAPI client maps them. Both shims now copy the full set, and the corresponding `UnifiedMarket` / `UnifiedEvent` interfaces in `models.ts` / `models.py` declare the new fields. The 2.25.1 release fixed the sidecar end of the pipe; this release fixes the SDK consumer end.

## [2.25.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Polymarket: dropped market fields**: `mapMarketToUnified` now populates `slug` (from Gamma `slug`), `tickSize` (from `orderPriceMinTickSize`), `status` (from `archived` > `closed` > `active` precedence), and `contractAddress` (from `conditionId`). These were silently dropped during normalization and surfaced as `undefined` to consumers.
- **OpenAPI spec drift**: `core/scripts/generate-openapi.js` was missing several `UnifiedEvent` and `UnifiedMarket` fields that already existed in `types.ts` (`UnifiedEvent.volume`, `UnifiedEvent.volume24h`, `UnifiedMarket.slug`, `UnifiedMarket.tickSize`) plus `CreateOrderParams.tickSize` / `CreateOrderParams.negRisk`. The generated `openapi.yaml` and downstream typed SDKs (e.g. `pmxtjs`) stripped these fields at the client boundary, producing NULL columns in catalog ingest pipelines. Generator now declares the full set so they round-trip end-to-end.
- **`UnifiedMarket` type**: Added `status` and `contractAddress` to the type declaration so the new Polymarket fields are visible to TypeScript consumers.

## [2.25.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Polymarket US Exchange Integration** 🇺🇸: New adapter wrapping the official `polymarket-us` SDK for the US-regulated Polymarket gateway. Supports `fetchMarkets` / `fetchEvents` (by slug, event, or outcomeId), `fetchOrderBook`, `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`, `fetchMyTrades`, `fetchOpenOrders`, `fetchOrder`, `createOrder` / `buildOrder` / `submitOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and WebSocket streaming via `watchOrderBook` / `watchTrades` (backed by the SDK's `MarketsWebSocket`; credentials are required because the SDK factory mandates `keyId` + `secretKey` even for the public market socket). Handles the long-side price convention (all API prices are YES-side; short-side inputs are auto-converted via `1 - price`), normalizes outcomes to `${slug}:long` / `${slug}:short`, surfaces live prices from `marketSides[].price` (with `outcomePrices[]` fallback), lifts `orderPriceMinTickSize` onto `UnifiedMarket.tickSize`, and stashes human side labels (e.g. team names) in outcome metadata. Maintains an in-memory `orderId -> marketSlug` cache so `cancelOrder(orderId)` can supply the SDK-required body field. The normalizer reads the real gateway response shape (`question`, `endDate`, `category`, `tags`, `marketSides`) rather than the SDK's declared types. Prices serialize at 3-decimal precision (`"0.864"`) and the default tick size is `0.001`, matching observed live markets. Includes unit tests covering price conversion, normalizer, error mapping, the exchange wrapper, and the WebSocket layer, plus a live-gateway smoke script (`core/scripts/smoke-polymarket-us.ts`).

  Polymarket US is a **distinct exchange** from the international Polymarket adapter — different API, different auth, different price convention. Usage is parallel:

  ```typescript
  import { Polymarket, PolymarketUS } from 'pmxtjs';

  // International Polymarket (USDC on-chain wallet)
  const intl = new Polymarket({
    privateKey: process.env.POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    funderAddress: process.env.POLYMARKET_FUNDER_ADDRESS!,
  });
  const intlMarkets = await intl.fetchMarkets({ limit: 10 });
  console.log(intlMarkets[0].yes.price);

  // Polymarket US (API key + secret, USD-denominated)
  const us = new PolymarketUS({
    keyId: process.env.POLYMARKET_US_KEY_ID!,
    secretKey: process.env.POLYMARKET_US_SECRET_KEY!,
  });
  const usMarkets = await us.fetchMarkets({ limit: 10 });
  console.log(usMarkets[0].yes.price); // populated from marketSides[].price
  ```

## [2.24.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Polymarket US Exchange Integration**: New adapter wrapping the official `polymarket-us` SDK. Supports `fetchMarkets` / `fetchEvents` (by slug, event, or outcomeId), `fetchOrderBook`, `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`, `fetchMyTrades`, `fetchOpenOrders`, `fetchOrder`, `createOrder` / `buildOrder` / `submitOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and WebSocket streaming via `watchOrderBook` / `watchTrades` (backed by the SDK's `MarketsWebSocket`; credentials are required because the SDK factory mandates `keyId` + `secretKey` even for the public market socket). Handles the long-side price convention (all API prices are YES-side; short-side inputs are auto-converted via `1 - price`), normalizes outcomes to `${slug}:long` / `${slug}:short`, surfaces human side labels (e.g. team names) from `marketSides[].description` in outcome metadata, and maintains an in-memory `orderId -> marketSlug` cache so `cancelOrder(orderId)` can supply the SDK-required body field. The normalizer reads the real gateway response shape (`question`, `endDate`, `category`, `tags`, `marketSides`) rather than the SDK's declared types. Includes unit tests covering price conversion, normalizer, error mapping, the exchange wrapper, and the WebSocket layer.
- **Smarkets Exchange Integration**: Full support for the Smarkets betting exchange with session-based authentication. Browse leaf events and markets via `fetchEvents` and `fetchMarkets`, query order books, place and cancel orders, and read balances. Includes correct array parameter serialization for the Smarkets API and `type_scope=single_event` filtering for leaf events. Comes with unit tests covering price conversion, auth, normalizer, and error translation.

### Fixed

- **Polymarket: Silent Zero Balance**: `fetchBalance` now catches the bundled `@polymarket/clob-client` `TypeError` thrown when `getOpenOrders` spreads an HTTP error envelope and translates it to a clear `AuthenticationError` with onboarding guidance. Also validates `getBalanceAllowance` shape so a swallowed error envelope no longer produces `NaN` and disables the on-chain fallback.
- **Polymarket: Proxy Discovery**: `auth.getClobClient` now runs `discoverProxy` whenever `signatureType` is missing (even if `funderAddress` is set), ignores the synthetic EOA fallback from failed discovery, and defaults to `gnosissafe` (2) when the funder differs from the signer EOA. Fixes silent zero balances for modern Polymarket accounts. Closes #72.
- **Polymarket: Env Configuration**: `server/app.ts` now reads `POLYMARKET_FUNDER_ADDRESS` / `POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS` and `POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE` from the environment so SDK users can configure them without code changes.

## [2.23.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Metaculus Exchange Integration**: Full support for the Metaculus reputation-based forecasting platform. Browse questions, community predictions, and tournament structures via `fetchMarkets` and `fetchEvents`. Submit probability forecasts via `createOrder` (binary and multiple-choice questions) and withdraw them via `cancelOrder`. Group-of-questions posts are automatically expanded into individual sub-question markets. Token-based authentication via `{ apiToken: "..." }`.
- **Python SDK: Token Auth**: `Exchange` base class and `Metaculus` subclass now accept `api_token` for token-based authentication, with credential forwarding to the sidecar server.
- **Python SDK: Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit test suite for the Python client wrapper (`test_client.py`, `conftest.py`) covering market fetching, order creation, filtering, error handling, and credential forwarding.

### Fixed

- **Probable Auth: viem Type Mismatch**: Resolved `WalletClient` type disagreement when `@prob/clob` resolves a different viem copy than the host package.

### Changed

- **TypeScript SDK**: Bumped `ts-jest` to `^29.4.9`.

## [2.22.2] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- **MarketOutcome Shorthand Consistency**: `fetchOrderBook`, `fetchOHLCV`, `fetchTrades`, `watchOrderBook`, and `watchTrades` now accept a `MarketOutcome` object directly (e.g. `market.yes`) in both Python and TypeScript SDKs, matching the existing behavior of `createOrder` and `buildOrder`.

## [2.22.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Consistent OrderBook Error Handling**: Kalshi, Limitless, and Baozi now throw `NotFound` errors for non-existing orderbooks instead of silently returning empty data. All exchanges now behave consistently with Polymarket.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Opinion Exchange Integration**: Full support for Opinion prediction market -- markets, events, OHLCV, order book, positions, orders, execution price, and WebSocket streaming. Includes `fetchMyTrades`, `fetchClosedOrders`, `fetchAllOrders`, and `cancelOrder`. Does not yet support `fetchTrades` or `fetchBalance`.

## [2.21.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Polymarket Per-Market Images**: Multi-market events (e.g. FIFA World Cup, Presidential Nominee) now correctly use each market's own image instead of the parent event image. Image precedence is now `market.image` > `event.image` > OG fallback.

## [2.21.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Zenodo DOI Integration**: Zenodo now automatically creates a DOI for each release, enabling reliable academic citation.

## [2.21.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Typed Error Classes (Python SDK)**: 14 error classes (`BadRequest`, `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitExceeded`, `NotFoundError`, etc.) mirroring `core/src/errors.ts`. Server error responses are automatically parsed into typed exceptions via `from_server_error()`. All catch blocks in the client now raise specific `PmxtError` subclasses instead of generic `Exception`.
- **Typed Error Classes (TypeScript SDK)**: Matching error hierarchy with `fromServerError()` factory. `handleResponse()` and all HTTP error paths now throw typed `PmxtError` subclasses. All error classes exported from the package.

### Fixed

- **Credential Logging (Security)**: Removed plaintext logging of API credentials in Polymarket auth flow.
- **Hardcoded Price Fallbacks**: Replaced `0.5` fallback prices with `0` in Kalshi, Baozi, and Myriad normalizers. Missing price data now correctly indicates "no price" instead of silently fabricating a 50-cent midpoint.

## [2.20.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **Kalshi API v2 Compatibility**: Handle renamed trade fields (`yes_price` → `yes_price_dollars`, `count` → `count_fp`). Normalizer now parses both old (cents int) and new (dollar string) formats, fixing `NaN` prices and `undefined` amounts in `fetchTrades` / `fetchMyTrades`.

### Changed

- **Compliance Test Hardening**: `fetchOHLCV` tries multiple resolutions (`1d`, `6h`, `1h`) coarsest-first across top markets by volume instead of giving up early. `watchTrades` filters for markets traded within the last 5 minutes and applies a 10-minute recency gate before attempting WebSocket watches.
- **Broader Skip Conditions**: `isSkippableError` now handles `AuthenticationError`, `PermissionDenied`, missing credentials, and ESM import failures. Individual tests (`createOrder`, `fetchPositions`) cover additional expected rejection messages.
- **KalshiDemoExchange Excluded**: Removed from compliance test matrix (redundant, no separate demo credentials).
- **SDK Integration Tests**: Added server-availability guard so tests skip gracefully when the PMXT server is not running.

## [2.20.2] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Probable Events API**: Handle raw array response instead of expected `{ events: [] }` wrapper.
- **Test Import**: Remove vitest import from client-args test (project uses Jest).

### Changed

- **3-Layer Architecture**: Introduced fetcher/normalizer/SDK layer separation across all exchanges (Myriad, Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Baozi, Probable).
- **Stale File Cleanup**: Removed superseded `fetchX.ts` files from all exchanges, rewired websocket modules to use the new fetcher layer.

## [2.20.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Error Mapper: SDK Error Extraction** (#56): Third-party SDK errors (e.g. `@polymarket/clob-client`) that attach HTTP metadata (`.status`, `.statusCode`, `.response`) to `Error` instances are now properly mapped to specific error classes (`InsufficientFunds`, `AuthenticationError`, `InvalidOrder`, etc.) instead of falling through to a generic `BadRequest`. The error mapper also extracts the real API error message from `.response.data` instead of using the SDK's generic `.message`.

### Changed

- **Error Mapper: Deduplicated Status Code Mapping**: Extracted shared `mapByStatusCode()` method to eliminate duplicated switch logic across axios, plain-object, and SDK error handling paths.

## [2.20.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Address Watcher & Subscriber System**: Introduced `watchAddress()` and `unwatchAddress()` methods on `BaseExchange`, along with a new subscriber infrastructure (`core/src/subscriber/`) for monitoring on-chain address activity. Supports optional address parameter for flexible subscription management.
- **GoldSky Integration**: Added GoldSky GraphQL subscription implementation (`core/src/subscriber/external/goldsky.ts`) for real-time on-chain event streaming. Integrated into the Limitless exchange for live data feeds.
- **Whale Tracker Examples**: Added Python and TypeScript example scripts (`core/examples/social/`) demonstrating how to track large-position holders using the SDK.
- **SDK: `buildOrder` / `submitOrder` Support**: Both the Python and TypeScript SDKs now expose `buildOrder()` and `submitOrder()` methods, along with the `BuiltOrder` type, enabling the two-step order workflow introduced in v2.19.0.
- **Trade `outcomeId` Field**: Added `outcomeId` (asset ID) to the `Trade` type for clearer asset-level trade identification.

### Fixed

- **Kalshi Orderbook**: Switched from the removed legacy `orderbook` field to `orderbook_fp`, fixing broken orderbook fetches on the Kalshi exchange.
- **Limitless `baseUrl` Parameter**: Fixed incorrect base URL handling in the Limitless exchange configuration.
- **Exchange Imports**: Fixed missing or incorrect `index.ts` imports across exchange modules.
- **Test Infrastructure**: Replaced vitest imports with Jest globals in price tests to match the project's test runner.
- **Whale Tracker Examples & SDK Bugs**: Fixed issues in example scripts and resolved minor SDK client bugs.
- **TypeScript SDK Merge Conflicts**: Resolved merge conflicts in the TypeScript SDK client.

### Changed

- **Polymarket WebSocket**: Enriched the Polymarket websocket implementation with improved event handling and user position tracking.
- **Limitless WebSocket & GoldSky Integration**: Refactored the Limitless exchange to integrate GoldSky watcher and subscriber, with improved websocket configuration.
- **Exchange Interfaces**: Refactored `BaseExchange` interfaces, updated type names, and standardized exchange interface implementations across Polymarket, Limitless, Myriad, and others.
- **Price Helpers**: Centralized exchange price helpers and standardized argument building across exchanges.
- **Watcher Dispatch Optimization**: Updated the watcher to dispatch events only when there is an actual change, reducing unnecessary notifications.
- **OpenAPI & API Reference**: Auto-regenerated `openapi.yaml` and `API_REFERENCE.md` to reflect all new endpoints and types.
- **SDK Models & Documentation**: Updated Python and TypeScript SDK models, API reference docs, and added client example code.

## [2.19.6] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **TypeScript SDK Auto-Generation**: Upgraded `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-client-methods.js` to derive return types and patterns directly from the `BaseExchange.ts` AST, mirroring the Python generator. The manual `METHOD_RETURN_CONFIG` has been eliminated, permanently removing the risk of documentation and signature drift.

### Fixed

- **CI/CD: SDK Drift Guards**: Removed the `paths` filter from `python-client-check.yml` and `typescript-client-check.yml`. These drift guards now run on *every* pull request. Previously, manual edits to `client.py` or `client.ts` would bypass the check if the PR didn't also touch `BaseExchange.ts` or the generator scripts.

## [2.19.5] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **SDK: Resilient Authentication (Python & TypeScript)**: Eliminated "Unauthorized: Invalid or missing access token" errors caused by sidecar server restarts. Both the Python and TypeScript SDKs now read the access token fresh from the `~/.pmxt/server.lock` file on every request via a new `getAuthHeaders` helper. This ensures that if the server rebooted and rotated tokens, existing `Exchange` instances (like `Polymarket`) automatically pick up the new valid token on their next call, removing the need for developers to manually re-instantiate clients.
- **SDK: Generator Persistence (Python & TypeScript)**: Updated both `sdks/python/scripts/generate-client-methods.js` and `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-client-methods.js` to emit the live header retrieval pattern, ensuring authentication resilience is maintained in all future auto-generated methods.

## [2.19.4] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Python SDK Auto-Generation**: Added a reflection script (`sdks/python/scripts/generate-client-methods.js`) to automatically generate Python SDK client methods directly from the TypeScript `BaseExchange.ts` AST. This completely eliminates API structure drift between the TypeScript core and the Python client, ensuring new methods and parameter changes immediately reflect in Python. Added a CI guard (`python-client-check.yml`) to enforce synchronization on all Pull Requests.

### Fixed

- **Compliance Tests: Resilient Exchange Availability Checks**: Compliance tests no longer fail when an exchange's API is temporarily unavailable (e.g., Myriad returning a Heroku 503 error page). Previously, any `ExchangeNotAvailable` or `NetworkError` exception would propagate as a test failure, making CI fragile against external service outages. A new `isSkippableError(error)` helper in `core/test/compliance/shared.ts` returns `true` for these error types (plus the existing "not implemented" and "not supported" string checks), and all 18 compliance test files now call it uniformly instead of ad-hoc string comparisons. Tests now log a skip message and return instead of failing.

- **`generate-openapi.test.ts` Spec Leak**: The OpenAPI auto-generation test temporarily injects a `testDummyMethod` into `BaseExchange.ts` and regenerates the spec to verify the generator works. However, `afterAll` only restored `BaseExchange.ts` — not `openapi.yaml` — leaving the `testDummyMethod` endpoint permanently in the committed spec and silently dropping the `close` endpoint's description. `afterAll` now also restores `openapi.yaml` to its pre-test state.

## [2.19.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **TypeScript build failure due to missing `buildOrder` and `submitOrder` in exchange `has` objects**: When the new build-only order methods were added to the `ExchangeHas` interface, several exchange implementations were not updated to include these properties. Added `buildOrder: false` and `submitOrder: false` to BaoziExchange, LimitlessExchange, MyriadExchange, and ProbableExchange to match the interface requirements.

## [2.19.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **OpenAPI Schema for `BuiltOrder`**: The `buildOrder` and `submitOrder` endpoints referenced the `BuiltOrder` type in the OpenAPI spec but the schema definition was missing from the components section, causing SDK code generation to fail. The `BuiltOrder` schema is now properly defined in the OpenAPI generator.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Build-Only Order Mode**: Introduced `buildOrder()` and `submitOrder()` methods enabling a two-step order workflow. This allows integrators (e.g., Smart Order Routers) to build exchange-native order payloads, inspect or forward them through middleware, then submit them later without reconstructing parameters.
  - **New Type**: `BuiltOrder` interface containing the exchange name, original params, and exchange-native payload (with optional `signedOrder` for CLOB exchanges and reserved `tx` field for future on-chain exchanges).
  - **New Methods**: `buildOrder(params)` constructs the order without submitting; `submitOrder(built)` submits a pre-built order.
  - **Capability Flags**: Both methods exposed in `exchange.has` (e.g., `exchange.has.buildOrder`, `exchange.has.submitOrder`).
  - **Polymarket Support**: `buildOrder` uses the CLOB client's `createOrder()` method to sign the order; `submitOrder` uses `postOrder()` to submit the signed payload. Refactored `createOrder` to delegate to both for backwards compatibility.
  - **Kalshi Support**: `buildOrder` constructs the request body without making an HTTP call; `submitOrder` POSTs the pre-built body to the CreateOrder endpoint. Refactored `createOrder` to maintain compatibility.
  - **Limitless**: Not yet supported (`buildOrder: false`), as the SDK lacks a distinct build-without-submit pattern.

### Changed

- **OpenAPI Auto-generation**: Updated the OpenAPI generator to recognize the new `BuiltOrder` type and auto-generate corresponding REST endpoints for `buildOrder` and `submitOrder`.

## [2.18.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Kalshi `UnifiedEvent.description` always empty**: Kalshi's `mututals_description` field is always `null` in their API responses, so `UnifiedEvent.description` was an empty string for every event. The Kalshi adapter now derives a description from the markets' `rules_primary` text by extracting the longest common prefix and suffix across all child markets and substituting the variable region with `{x}`. For example, a 34-market event produces `"If {x} announces a presidential campaign to contest the presidential nomination of the Democratic party for the 2028 U.S. presidential election, then the market resolves to Yes."` Single-market events return the `rules_primary` text as-is. Events where no meaningful template can be extracted (shared fixed text < 20 chars, or all markets identical) fall back to the first market's `rules_primary`.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-02-27

  ### Fixed
  - `UnifiedEvent` now includes `volume24h` and `volume` fields, summed from child markets at
    normalization time. Previously these fields were absent despite being the natural aggregate
    of each market's volume. Sort-by-volume on event listings now works without manual aggregation
    by the caller.

  ### Changed
  - `UnifiedEvent.volume24h: number` is now a required field (mirrors `UnifiedMarket.volume24h`).
  - `UnifiedEvent.volume?: number` is now an optional field (mirrors `UnifiedMarket.volume`);
    only populated when at least one child market exposes lifetime volume.

## [2.17.9] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK: Server startup race condition causes 401 Unauthorized**: After a version mismatch was detected, the `ServerManager` would kill the old server and delete the lock file, then call `waitForServer()`. Because the lock file was gone, `getRunningPort()` fell back to the default port 3847. If any other process (e.g. an unrelated local server) was already responding on that port, `waitForServer()` would return immediately with no lock file present, causing `getAccessToken()` to return `undefined` and all subsequent API requests to be sent without an auth token. Fixed by rewriting `waitForServer()` to read the lock file directly on each poll iteration and only return when a lock file is present *and* the server at that file's port passes a health check. This prevents falsely matching an unrelated server on the default port.

## [2.17.8] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Python SDK `fetch_ohlcv` deserialization error**: Calling `fetch_ohlcv()` raised `ValueError: Multiple matches found when deserializing... with oneOf schemas: HistoryFilterParams, OHLCVParams` because the OpenAPI spec emitted `oneOf: [OHLCVParams, HistoryFilterParams]` for the `params` argument. Since both schemas are structurally identical in JSON (same four fields, differing only in `resolution` being optional vs. required), pydantic matched both branches and raised an exception. Fixed by removing the deprecated `HistoryFilterParams` union from `fetchOHLCV` in `BaseExchange.ts` and all exchange implementations, then regenerating the OpenAPI spec. The spec now emits only `OHLCVParams` for this parameter. `fetchTrades` is unaffected as its `HistoryFilterParams | TradesParams` union has no structural ambiguity.

## [2.17.7] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Python SDK Missing Exchange Classes**: `pmxt.Probable`, `pmxt.Baozi`, and `pmxt.Myriad` raised `AttributeError` on import because the Python SDK's exchange subclasses were maintained manually and had drifted from the TypeScript core. All three classes are now available.

### Infrastructure

- **Auto-generated Python SDK exchange classes**: `sdks/python/pmxt/_exchanges.py` is now generated from `core/src/server/app.ts` (the single source of truth for registered exchanges) via `core/scripts/generate-python-exchanges.js`. The generator also keeps `__init__.py` imports and `__all__` in sync. A CI guard (`python-exchanges-check.yml`) fails any PR where the generated file diverges from the committed one.
- **Auto-generated `COMPLIANCE.md`**: The feature support matrix is now generated from exchange implementations via `core/scripts/generate-compliance.js`, replacing the previously manual document. A CI guard (`compliance-check.yml`) keeps it in sync with `core/src/exchanges/*/index.ts`.
- **TypeScript SDK client methods CI guard**: Added `typescript-client-check.yml` to fail PRs where `BaseExchange.ts` changes without regenerating the corresponding methods in the TypeScript SDK `client.ts`.
- All three generators are wired into `generate:sdk:all` and run automatically on every publish.

## [2.17.6] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Duplicate `eventId` in `UnifiedMarket` causes build failure**: The v2.17.5 fix added `eventId?: string` to `core/src/types.ts` but the field already existed at line 34, resulting in `TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'eventId'` and a broken build. The duplicate declaration is removed.

## [2.17.5] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **`UnifiedMarket.event` circular type corrected to `eventId`**: The `event?: UnifiedEvent` field on `UnifiedMarket` (in both `core/src/types.ts` and the TypeScript SDK `models.ts`) was a design error — storing a full back-reference to the parent event creates a circular structure that breaks `JSON.stringify`. The field is now typed as `eventId?: string`, consistent with how every exchange util already populated it. The TypeScript SDK's `convertMarket` function now also passes `eventId` through from the server response.

## [2.17.4] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Polymarket Cloudflare WAF Bypass**: The User-Agent header added in v2.17.2 was insufficient to bypass Polymarket's Cloudflare bot detection. Enhanced the Polymarket client with browser-mimicking headers (`Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Origin: https://polymarket.com`, `Referer`, and `sec-fetch-*` directives). These headers make requests appear as same-site CORS calls from the Polymarket frontend, allowing the API to pass Cloudflare's bot scoring model. `fetchEvents()` now works reliably on all platforms.

## [2.17.3] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Fatal Circular JSON Crash (`fetchEvents`)**: Fixed a `TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON` that fatally crashed the sidecar server on every `fetchEvents` call across all exchanges. The v2.17.2 patch injected `market.event = event` inside the core exchange functions, creating an `event → markets[0] → event` reference cycle. Since Express serializes sidecar responses via `JSON.stringify`, this caused an unrecoverable crash propagated to all SDK clients. The `market.event` back-references are now hydrated exclusively client-side inside `convertEvent` in the TypeScript SDK, keeping all sidecar REST payloads strictly acyclic.

## [2.17.2] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Bi-directional Navigation (`market.event`)**: Added `market.event` back-reference hydration to the TypeScript SDK's `convertEvent` function, enabling navigation from any market to its parent event. Note: this release accidentally also injected the circular reference server-side, causing a fatal JSON serialization crash fixed in v2.17.3.
- **Global User-Agent Header**: Added a default generic `User-Agent` header (`pmxt (https://github.com/pmxt-dev/pmxt)`) to the `BaseExchange` axios configuration. This ensures consistent identification across all exchanges and resolves the **Polymarket Discovery 401 Error** that occurred when calling `fetchEvents()` without parameters, effectively bypassing WAF/CDN restrictions.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Sidecar Bundle Drift**: The features shipped in 2.17.0 (parameterless `fetchEvents()`, Kalshi client-side sorting) were correctly implemented in TypeScript source but **never reached users** because the publish pipeline was missing the `bundle:server` step for the npm job. The distributed `pmxt-core` package contained a stale pre-compiled sidecar (`bundled.js`) from a previous release that still enforced the old guard `fetchEvents() requires a query, eventId, or slug parameter`. This patch rebuilds and ships the correct bundle.
- **CI/CD: Publish Workflow**: Added `npm run bundle:server` to the `publish-npm` job in `publish.yml`, immediately after the `Build Core` step. Without this, source-level changes to the sidecar server are silently ignored in all npm-distributed packages.
- **CI/CD: Test Workflow**: Applied the same fix to `test-publish.yml` so dry-run publishes and test runs also exercise the correct sidecar, preventing this class of drift from going undetected in future PRs.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-02-24

### Improved

- **Unified Discovery: Unrestricted Event Fetching**: Removed the mandatory requirement for a query, event identification, or slug in `fetchEvents`. Users can now call `fetchEvents()` without parameters to retrieve the "front page" of an exchange (typically top events by volume).
- **Polymarket: High-Performance Discovery**: Redirects no-query `fetchEvents` calls to the specific Gamma `/events` list endpoint, providing a cleaner and faster experience than the fuzzy search path.
- **Kalshi: Client-Side Event Ranking**: Implemented robust client-side sorting for Kalshi events. Since the Kalshi API lacks server-side sorting for the event list, `fetchEvents` now aggregates volume, liquidity, and recency from nested markets to provide consistent `sort` support (`volume`, `liquidity`, `newest`).
- **Limitless: Semantic Event Mapping**: Mapped Limitless "Group Markets" to the unified `fetchEvents` interface. Discovery calls now automatically filter for group markets, aligning Limitless with event-centric discovery patterns.
- **Developer Experience**: Synchronized `fetchEvents` behavior with `fetchMarkets` across all exchanges (Baozi, Myriad, Probable, Kalshi, Polymarket, Limitless).

### Fixed

- **Unit Tests**: Updated core validation suite to reflect the relaxed requirements for event fetching.

## [2.16.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Documentation: Automated Generator**: Fixed a bug in `generate-openapi.js` where certain model fields (like `eventId` and `sort`) were not being correctly reflected in the generated SDK documentation.
- **SDK: Regenerated Reference Docs**: Synchronized `API_REFERENCE.md` for both Python and TypeScript to include the newly added traversal and sorting capabilities.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Unified Traversal: Market-to-Event Linkage**: Added `eventId` to the `UnifiedMarket` interface across all exchanges. This allows direct navigation from a market back to its parent event container.
- **Unified Traversal: Outcome-to-Market Linkage**: Ensured `marketId` is consistently populated on all `MarketOutcome` objects.
- **Event Search: Unified Sorting**: Added `sort` parameter support to `fetchEvents` for better developer experience and consistency with `fetchMarkets`.

### Improved

- **Polymarket: Direct Event Lookup**: Enhanced `fetchEvents` for Polymarket to support direct `eventId` and `slug` lookups, removing the previous requirement for a keyword search query when the ID is already known.
- **Cross-Exchange Consistency**: Synchronized `fetchEvents` and `fetchMarkets` behavior across Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, Myriad, and Probable.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **TypeScript SDK: Automated Client Method Generation**: Introduced `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-client-methods.js`, a script that introspects `BaseExchange.ts` via the TypeScript AST and auto-generates typed client method stubs in `client.ts`. This ensures the TypeScript SDK stays in sync with core method additions without manual updates.
- **TypeScript SDK: SDK Surface Area Tests**: Added `sdks/typescript/tests/surface.test.ts` with 175 tests (25 public methods × 7 exchange classes). These tests verify that every method defined in `BaseExchange` is correctly exposed on all exchange clients (Polymarket, Kalshi, KalshiDemo, Limitless, Myriad, Probable, Baozi). No server required — prototype checks only.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK: Integration Test Reliability**: Refactored `sdks/typescript/tests/integration.test.ts` to use a shared `beforeAll` per describe block (avoiding redundant API calls per test), pass `{ limit: 5 }` to both Polymarket and Kalshi `fetchMarkets` to prevent full-catalog fetches, and set a 120s `beforeAll` timeout to handle Polymarket Gamma API response variance (which can exceed 30s under load). All 6 integration tests now pass reliably.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Sidecar Server Build**: Resolved a critical TypeScript compilation error in `app.ts` caused by an invalid Express error handler signature. This fix ensures the unified sidecar server can be successfully bundled and published.

- **Client Implementation**: Corrected calling conventions and type references in `client.ts` for `fetchBalance`, `cancelOrder`, and `fetchOrder` to align with the latest generated types.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK Build**: Resolved critical compilation errors introduced by OpenAPI spec auto-generation (v2.13.0).
  - Added missing `title` fields to inline request schemas in `openapi.yaml` (cancelOrder, fetchOrder endpoints) so the OpenAPI generator creates proper named types.
  - Fixed incorrect type references in `client.ts` `fetchOrder` method (was using `CancelOrderRequest` instead of `FetchOrderRequest`).
  - Enhanced `fix-generated.js` post-processing script to properly handle union type discriminators and TypeScript type narrowing issues in generated code.
  - Fixed type narrowing failures in `FilterEventsRequestArgsInner` and `FilterMarketsRequestArgsInner` by adding explicit type casts in `.every()` and `.map()` calls.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Unified Sidecar API Expansion**: Formally exposed `fetchMyTrades`, `fetchClosedOrders`, and `fetchAllOrders` in the sidecar server and generated SDKs, completing the functional rollout of the Order History API.
- **New Public Methods**: Introduced `loadMarkets()` and `fetchMarketsPaginated()` to the public SDKs for stateful market caching and stable pagination support.
- **OpenAPI Auto-Generation**: Implemented a reflection-based specification generator (`core/scripts/generate-openapi.js`) that automatically derives the sidecar API from the `BaseExchange` TypeScript definition.
- **CI Synchronization Check**: Added a GitHub Action workflow to ensure the OpenAPI spec and SDKs stay perfectly in sync with the core library on every contribution.

### Changed

- **SDK Feature Parity**: Regenerated both Python and TypeScript SDKs to include the latest unified methods and data models (e.g., `UserTrade`, `PaginatedMarketsResult`).

### Documentation

- **Contributor Workflow**: Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions on using the new automated OpenAPI generation pipeline.


## [2.12.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

### Changed

- **Testing Utilities**: Added `validateUserTrade` to compliance test suite for standardized trade verification.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **CCXT-Style Rate Limiting**: Implemented automatic rate limiting across all exchanges using a token bucket (leaky bucket) algorithm, preventing 429 errors and request throttling.
  - **Unified Throttling**: All REST requests (both explicit and via `callApi`) automatically respect exchange rate limits through a single axios request interceptor on `this.http`.
  - **Per-Exchange Configuration**: Each exchange sets its own rate limit (e.g., Polymarket: 200ms, Kalshi: 100ms, Myriad/Baozi/Probable: 500ms).
  - **User Control**: Developers can override rate limits per-instance (`exchange.rateLimit = 50`) or disable entirely (`exchange.enableRateLimit = false`).
  - **Leaky Bucket Implementation**: Queue-based token refill with no busy spinning, maintaining simplicity while ensuring fair request spacing.
- **Throttler Utility**: New `Throttler` class in `core/src/utils/throttler.ts` providing a standalone, exchange-agnostic token bucket implementation for queue-based async throttling.

### Changed

- **BaseExchange**: Added `rateLimit` property (default 1000ms) and `enableRateLimit` property (default true) to match CCXT conventions.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Low-Level API Access (`callApi` / `call_api`)**: Exposed a new method on all exchange instances that allows direct invocation of any exchange-specific REST endpoint by its OpenAPI `operationId`. This gives advanced users full access to every underlying API endpoint (Polymarket CLOB/Gamma/Data, Kalshi, Limitless, Probable, Myriad) without leaving the unified SDK interface.
  - TypeScript: `await exchange.callApi('operationName', { param: 'value' })`
  - Python: `exchange.call_api('operation_name', {'param': 'value'})`
- **Low-Level API Reference Documentation**: Both Python and TypeScript API reference docs now include a comprehensive "Low-Level API Reference" section listing every available endpoint per exchange, with method, path, parameters, and auth requirements.

### Documentation

- **API Reference Templates**: Updated Handlebars templates and the doc generation pipeline to render per-exchange endpoint tables and detailed parameter listings from OpenAPI specs.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-02-19

### Documentation

- **Pagination Stability Guidance**: Clarified that repeated `fetchMarkets()` calls with different `offset` values do not guarantee stable ordering. Added guidance and examples on using `loadMarkets()` as the correct approach for stable iteration over the entire market catalog. (Closes #41)
- **Automatic Statistics**: Updated specific total download badges and metadata.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-02-18

### Documentation

- **Internal Links in API Reference**: Return types and complex parameters in the Python and TypeScript API reference documentation are now linkified. Clicking on a data model (e.g., `Order`, `UnifiedMarket`) now jumps directly to its detailed field definition at the bottom of the page.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **TypeScript SDK (Windows)**: Fixed a crash when spawning `pmxt-ensure-server` on Windows where the `.js` launcher must be invoked via `node` explicitly. The SDK now detects the platform and spawns `node <path>` when the resolved launcher ends in `.js`. (Closes #29)

### Added

- **Implicit API Generation**: Implemented automatic HTTP method generation from OpenAPI specifications in `BaseExchange`. Exchange classes can now register an OpenAPI spec and have typed HTTP methods created dynamically, significantly reducing boilerplate when adding new exchanges or API endpoints.
  - Added `ApiDescriptor` interface and `parseOpenApiSpec` utility.
  - Added `initAuth()` method for credential initialization and HMAC-SHA256 signing for Polymarket L2 API authentication.
  - API credentials are cached for synchronous signing operations.
  - Full implicit API support added to `PolymarketExchange` for all three services (CLOB, Gamma, Data APIs).

### Changed

- **Centralized Request Handling (`callApi`)**: Refactored all major exchange implementations (Kalshi, Polymarket, Limitless, Probable, Myriad) to route API calls through a unified `callApi` method on `BaseExchange`. This ensures consistent error mapping, logging, and interceptor behavior across all exchanges.
- **Consolidated Exchange Methods**: Moved standalone per-feature files (`fetchPositions.ts`, `fetchOrderBook.ts`, `fetchTrades.ts`, `fetchOHLCV.ts`) into their respective exchange class files. Deleted the now-redundant standalone files.
- **Centralized OpenAPI Specs**: Migrated API specifications from the root directory into structured `core/specs/` subdirectories (kalshi, limitless, myriad, polymarket, probable). The `fetch-openapi-specs` script now supports both remote URL fetching and local file reading.
- **Myriad**: Inlined `fetchTrades` logic directly into WebSocket polling and migrated to `callApi`. Fixed outcomeId parsing for composite IDs.
- **OpenAPI Utility**: Operations without explicit security definitions now correctly inherit top-level security settings.

### Documentation

- **SubParams in API Reference**: Sub-parameters for methods like `fetchMarkets` and `fetchEvents` (e.g., `query`, `slug`, `limit`, `offset`, `sort`, `searchIn`) are now rendered as nested bullet points directly under the method in both Python and TypeScript API reference docs.
- **Implicit API Pattern**: Added detailed documentation of the Implicit API pattern to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Exchange Integration Guide**: Refactored `core/ADDING_AN_EXCHANGE.md` to reflect the new `callApi`-based implementation approach.

## [2.0.11] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Limitless Pagination**: Implemented automatic pagination for limits greater than 25 markets. The Limitless API has a hard limit of 25 items per request, so this update introduces internal pagination that transparently handles any limit value. Over-fetches by 70% to account for ~33% of markets being filtered out due to missing tokens, then applies limit after filtering to ensure users get the exact requested number of valid markets. (Fixes #34)

## [2.0.10] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Polymarket WebSocket License**: Updated `@nevuamarkets/poly-websockets` dependency from AGPL-3.0 versions to MIT version, resolving license incompatibility warnings. Removed all AGPL-3.0 references from source code comments and error messages to ensure full MIT license compliance. (Fixes #35)

## [2.0.9] - 2026-02-09

## [2.0.7] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Python SDK**: Robust parsing for `resolution_date` in the `UnifiedMarket` model. The SDK now gracefully handles both ISO string formats (with "Z" or timezone offsets) and native `datetime` objects, preventing parsing errors for markets with irregular resolution data.

## [2.0.6f] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **OHLCV Validation**: Added explicit runtime validation for the `resolution` parameter in `fetchOHLCV` to ensure API compliance and better error messaging.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **Unified API Refined**: Split historical data parameters into `OHLCVParams` and `TradesParams` to better reflect their different nature.
  - `fetchOHLCV` now uses `OHLCVParams` (where `resolution` is required).
  - `fetchTrades` now uses `TradesParams` (where `resolution` is removed, as trades are discrete events).
- **TypeScript SDK**: Added dedicated interfaces for `OHLCVParams` and `TradesParams`.
- **Python SDK**: Updated type hints and documentation to reflect the refined parameter structure.
- **OpenAPI**: Updated specification with dedicated schemas for OHLCV and Trade parameters.

### Deprecated

- **`resolution` in `fetchTrades`**: The `resolution` parameter is now deprecated for trade history lookups and will be ignored. A console warning has been added for backward compatibility; it will be removed in v3.0.0.

## [2.0.2] & [2.0.3] & [2.0.4] - 2026-02-05


### Fixed

- **UnifiedEvent Model**: Added the native `UnifiedEvent` dataclass to the Python SDK for better type safety when using hierarchical search.
- **Semantic Aliases**: Added a `.question` property alias to `UnifiedMarket` in the Python SDK, matching common developer expectations for prediction market queries.

### Fixed
- **Python SDK API Calls**: Fixed a regression where hierarchical search endpoints were missing from the auto-generated internal API client by implementing a robust manual fallback.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Python SDK Bundled Server**: Updated the internal bundled sidecar server to the latest version. This resolves a regression where the "Date Handling in OHLCV" fix (from v1.1.3) was not correctly applied in the Python distribution, causing `getTime is not a function` errors when fetching historical data.

### Improved
- **CI/CD**: Added an automated step to the GitHub Actions workflow to rebuild and bundle the sidecar server immediately before publishing the Python package, ensuring the PyPI distribution always contains the latest core server code.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Hierarchical Search API**: Introduced a new, cleaner way to discover markets via the `searchEvents` method.

### Added
- **Unified Semantic Shortcuts**: Introduced convenience properties for binary markets across all SDKs (Python and TypeScript).
  - **New Properties**: `market.yes`, `market.no`, `market.up`, and `market.down`.
  - **Intelligent Mapping**: Implemented shared core logic to automatically identify "Yes" vs "No" outcomes based on labels and common patterns (e.g., "Not X" pairs).
  - **Expressive Aliases**: Added `.up` and `.down` as semantic aliases for `.yes` and `.no` to improve readability for directional markets.

### Improved
- **Core Architecture**: Extracted market normalization logic into a shared utility to ensure absolute parity between exchange implementations.
- **SDK Parity**: Updated both auto-generated and handcrafted portions of the Python and TypeScript SDKs to expose the new fields with full type hinting.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

### Improved
- **Polymarket OHLCV**: Implemented robust client-side candle aggregation for Polymarket price history.
  - Previously: The endpoint returned raw trade/tick data points which could be noisy or misaligned.
  - Now: Data is properly bucketed into time intervals (candles) with accurate Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume calculations.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Date Handling in OHLCV**: Fixed a critical issue where the Python SDK (which serializes datetime objects as strings) was causing "getTime is not a function" errors in the TypeScript sidecar.
  - Implemented robust date parsing middleware in `fetchOHLCV` for both Polymarket and Kalshi exchanges.
  - The sidecar server now correctly accepts both native `Date` objects (from internal TS calls) and ISO 8601 strings (from external APIs/SDKs) for `start` and `end` parameters.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed
- **Server Lifecycle**: Resolved a critical race condition where multiple concurrent client instantiations (e.g., initializing both Polymarket and Kalshi simultaneously) would kill and restart the sidecar server, invalidating access tokens.
- **Version Detection**: Improved `package.json` discovery in the sidecar server to ensure correct version reporting in bundled environments.
- **SDK Stability**: Updated the Python `ServerManager` to be more tolerant of version suffixes (like `-b4` or `-dev`), preventing unnecessary server restarts during development.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25

- **Connection Stability**: Improved WebSocket reconnection logic and error handling to manage network disruptions gracefully.
- **Type Definitions**: Fixed several edge-case TypeScript errors in WebSocket event handlers.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Sidecar Security**: Implemented a secure handshake protocol between the SDK and the Node.js sidecar server to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Auto-Restart Handshake**: Added logic to automatically detect sidecar crashes and restart the process seamlessly.

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Pagination**: Fixed a critical bug in `fetchMarkets` where the `offset` parameter was incorrectly ignored, enabling full traversal of Kalshi's market catalog.
- **Metadata Management**: Improved reliability of internal metadata enrichment for Polymarket results.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Zero-Config SDK Installation**: The sidecar server (`pmxt-core`) is now bundled directly within the SDK distributions, enabling a single-command setup experience.
  - **Python**: Bundled the server logic into the `pmxt` package on PyPI.

### Fixed
- **Broken Documentation Links**: Resolved several dead links in the API Reference and Examples sections.
- **Installation Footprint**: Optimized the bundled server footprint for faster SDK installs.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-17

broken

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Core SDK (Universal)**: Implemented dynamic port detection via the `~/.pmxt/server.lock` file. This resolves `ConnectionRefusedError` issues when the default port (3847) is already in use and the server falls back to an alternative port.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Resolved a critical race condition where API calls could be executed before the internal server manager had finished starting the sidecar or detecting the actual running port. Standardized the initialization pattern using an internal `initPromise`.
- **TypeScript SDK**: Fixed `ServerManager` health checks to correctly target the dynamically detected port instead of always checking the default.
- **Python SDK**: Hardened the `ServerManager` logic and improved consistency with the TypeScript implementation.

### Added
- **Python**: Added `examples/test_port_detection.py` to demonstrate and verify the new dynamic port resolution logic.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-17

### Acknowledgments

This release represents a major milestone in making prediction market data accessible across all major programming languages. Special thanks to all contributors and early testers who helped shape this architecture.

---
 
## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **ESM Import Compatibility**: Fixed an issue where `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` in ES Module environments (e.g., Node.js with `"type": "module"`) would wrap the default export in an extra `.default` property, breaking the expected `pmxt.polymarket()` syntax. Added explicit named exports (`polymarket`, `kalshi`) to ensure proper CommonJS/ESM interoperability.

### Added
- **Named Exports**: You can now import exchanges directly using named imports: `import { polymarket, kalshi } from 'pmxtjs'` in addition to the default `import pmxt from 'pmxtjs'` syntax.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Zombie Files in `dist/`**: Implemented a `prebuild` step that automatically cleans the `dist/` folder before every build. This prevents "stuck on old code" issues on macOS/Windows caused by file-to-directory refactors (e.g., `Kalshi.js` becoming `kalshi/index.js`).

### Added
- **Automated Publishing**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and publish to npm whenever a new repository tag (e.g., `v0.4.3`) is pushed.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Description Field**: Corrected a mapping issue where the unified `description` field was being populated with `event.sub_title` or `market.subtitle` (which typically only contain dates). It now correctly uses `market.rules_primary`, providing the actual resolution criteria as intended.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Kalshi Metadata Enrichment**: Fixed a major data gap where Kalshi markets were returning empty `tags`. 
  - **The Issue**: The Kalshi `/events` and `/markets` endpoints do not expose tags. Tags are instead nested under the `/series` metadata, which wasn't being queried.
  - **The Fix**: Implemented a secondary fetch layer that retrieves Series metadata and maps it back to Markets.
  - **Unified Tags**: Standardized the provider data model by merging Kalshi's `category` and `tags` into a single unified `tags` array, ensuring consistency with Polymarket's data structure.

### Changed
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Modified `fetchMarkets` to fetch Series mapping in parallel with events and `getMarketsBySlug` to perform atomic enrichment.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Trading Support**: Added full trading support for **Polymarket** and **Kalshi**, including:
  - Order management: `createOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `fetchOrder`, `fetchOpenOrders`.
  - Account management: `fetchBalance`, `fetchPositions`.
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for all trading operations.
- **Examples**: Added new examples for trading and account data (e.g., `list_positions`).

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Refactored monolithic `Exchange` classes into modular files for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication**: Simplified Polymarket authentication workflow.
- **Documentation**: Updated `API_REFERENCE.md` with detailed trading and account management methods.

### Fixed
- **Jest Configuration**: Resolved issues with ES modules in dependencies for testing.
- **Kalshi Implementation**: Fixed various bugs such as ticker formatting and signature generation.

### CRITICAL NOTES
- Polymarket has been tested manually, and works.
- Kalshi HAS NOT been tested manually but has been implemented according to the kalshi docs.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Search Scope Control**: Added `searchIn` parameter to `searchMarkets` allowing 'title' (default), 'description', or 'both'.

### Changed
- **Default Search Behavior**: `searchMarkets` now defaults to searching only titles to reduce noise and improve relevance.
- **Improved Search Coverage**: Increased search depth for both Polymarket and Kalshi to cover all active markets (up to 100,000) instead of just the top results.

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Updated README Quick Example to be robust against empty results.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **CCXT Syntax Alignment**: Renamed core methods to follow `ccxt` conventions:
  - `getMarkets` -> `fetchMarkets`
  - `getOrderBook` -> `fetchOrderBook`
  - `getTradeHistory` -> `fetchTrades`
  - `getMarketHistory` -> `fetchOHLCV`
- **Namespace Support**: Implemented `pmxt` default export to allow usage like `pmxt.polymarket`.

### Improved
- **Kalshi OHLCV**: Enhanced price mapping and added mid-price fallback for historical data.
- **Examples**: Updated `historical_prices.ts` to use new method names and improved logic.

### Fixed
- **Type Definitions**: Updated internal interfaces to match the new naming scheme.
- **Documentation**: Updated test headers and file references.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**: Added missing `ts-jest` dependency to ensure tests run correctly.
- **Search Robustness**: Fixed a potential crash in `searchMarkets` for both Kalshi and Polymarket when handling markets with missing descriptions or titles.
- **Data Validation**: Added better error handling for JSON parsing in Polymarket outcomes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Breaking Changes
- **Unified Deep-Dive Method IDs**: Standardized the IDs used in deep-dive methods across exchanges to ensure consistency. This changes the return signatures of data methods.

### Improved
- **Examples**: Simplified and fixed examples, including `historical_prices`, `orderbook_depth`, and `search_grouping`, to better demonstrate library usage.
- **Example Data**: Updated default queries in examples for more relevant results.

### Documentation

- **License**: Added MIT License to the project.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed
- **Cleaner Logs**: Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `KalshiExchange` and `PolymarketExchange` to ensure a quieter library experience.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Switched noisy data parsing warnings to silent failures or internal handling.
- **Repository Restructuring**: Flattened project structure for easier development and publishing.
- **readme.md**: Pushed readme.md to npmjs.org

### Removed
- `Fetched n pages from Kalshi...` logs.
